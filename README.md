    <h1> React-TypeScript Form Handler </h1>
</div>

This repository was created with the intention of providing developers with a
sample on how to implement a form handler efficiently, easing out sharing the
state among inputs, managing the form state, data submission to a service and
data loading within that same form instance; all of it with the help of
[React Context API](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react#context-hooks) and
[Formik](https://formik.org/). For the
moment, to make a schema builder for runtime value parsing and validation, we
have support for [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).
